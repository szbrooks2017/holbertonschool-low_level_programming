# 0x08-recursion  
## About
This is the first project to introduce the C Programming language, it includes:
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- How to get the size of a specific type using unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
- use `gcc`, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## File Descriptions
[0-puts_recursion.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/0-puts_recursion.c) -  a bash script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

[1-print_rev_recursion.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c) - a bash script that compiles a C file but does not link.

[2-strlen_recursion.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c) -  a bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

[3-factorial.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/3-factorial.c) - a bash script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

[4-pow_recursion.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/4-pow_recursion.c) - a C program that prints a string exactly, followed by a new line, using only `puts`.

[6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/6-is_prime_number.c) - a C program that prints a string exactly, followed by a new line, using `printf`.

[7-is_palindrome.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/7-is_palindrome.c) - a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on, using  `sizeof`.
