# 0x1C-makefiles 
## About
This is the first project to introduce the C Programming language, it includes:
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- How to get the size of a specific type using unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
- use `gcc`, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## File Descriptions
[0-Makefile](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x1C-makefiles/0-Makefile) -  a bash script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

[1-Makefile](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x1C-makefiles/1-Makefile) - a bash script that compiles a C file but does not link.

[2-Makefile](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x1C-makefiles/2-Makefile) -  a bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

[3-Makefile](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x1C-makefiles/3-Makefile) - a bash script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

[4-Makefile](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x1C-makefiles/4-Makefile) - a C program that prints a string exactly, followed by a new line, using only `puts`.

[5-island_perimeter.py](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x1C-makefiles/5-island_perimeter.py) - a C program that prints a string exactly, followed by a new line, using `printf`.
