## About
This is an introduction to logical expressions for the C Programming language, it includes:
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered `TRUE` and `FALSE` in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- How to use variables with the `while` loop
- How to print variables using `printf`
- What is the ASCII character set
- What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags -m32 and -m64

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
