# 0x10-variadic_functions
## About
This is the first project to introduce the C Programming language, it includes:
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- How to get the size of a specific type using unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
- use `gcc`, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## File Descriptions
[0-sum_them_all.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x10-variadic_functions) -  a bash script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

[1-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-variadic_functions/0-sum_them_all.c) - a bash script that compiles a C file but does not link.

[2-print_strings.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-variadic_functions/1-print_numbers.c) -  a bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

[3-print_all.c](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-variadic_functions/3-print_all.c) - a bash script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

[variadic_functions.h](https://github.com/szbrooks2017/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-variadic_functions/variadic_functions.h) - a C program that prints a string exactly, followed by a new line, using only `puts`.
