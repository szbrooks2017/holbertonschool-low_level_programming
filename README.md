# 0x00-hello_world
## About
This is the first project to introduce the C Programming language, it includes:
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- How to get the size of a specific type using unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
- use `gcc`, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
